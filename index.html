        Leave that to me! Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!
        Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?

        A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own. Well,
        he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us. Look at
        him. He's headed for that small moon. I think I can get him before he
        gets there...he's almost in range. That's no moon! It's a space station.
        It's too big to be a space station. I have a very bad feeling about
        this. Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the
        auxiliary power. Why are we still moving towards it? We're caught in a
        tractor beam! It's pulling us in! But there's gotta be something you can
        do! There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm going
        to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a fight!
        You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secure this area until the alert is canceled. Give me regular reports.
        Do you know what's going on? Maybe it's another drill. What was that?
        Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

        Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where
        are we? Three-two-six-eight-two-seven. If we can just avoid any more
        female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here. Well, let's get
        moving! Where are you going? No, wait. They'll hear! Come here, you big
        coward! Chewie! Come here! Listen. I don't know who you are, or where
        you came from, but from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay? Look, Your
        Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take orders from one
        person! Me! It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big
        walking carpet out of my way? No reward is worth this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio! Get to the top! I can't Where
        could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in? They aren't here!
        Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured.
        Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on
        top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where
        could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are
        you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up
        and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level,
        will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the
        detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention
        level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying,
        Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My
        poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great.

        Take over! See to him! Look there! They're madmen! They're heading for
        the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Follow me! You
        stand guard. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits
        of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to
        maintenance. All right.

        Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about
        anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm
        trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't
        know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...
        No!
      </p>
      <p>
        Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't
        hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative. Negative! It didn't go in.
        It just impacted on the surface. Red Leader, we're right above you. Turn
        to point... oh-five, we'll cover for you. Stay there... I just lost my
        starboard engine. Get set to make your attack run.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the
        Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were
        suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better
        get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with
        those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me
        at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.
        Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't
        help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir,
        nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull
        people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to
        do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the
        Wookiee win.

        Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be
        destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape
        for the Princess this time. What's that? Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are
        you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction.
        What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
        smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going?
